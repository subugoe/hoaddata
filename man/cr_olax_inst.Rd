\description{
This dataset comprises affiliation information from first authors for each
open access article published in hybrid journals as listed in
\link[hoaddata]{oam_hybrid_jns}.
}
\details{
A first author is often considered as lead author(\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_author})
who has usually undertaken most of the research presented in the article,
although author roles can vary across disciplines.
We used OpenAlex as data source for determining the lead author's affiliation.

Variables:

\describe{
    \item{doi}{DOI for the OA article}
    \item{issn_l}{Linking International Standard Serial Number (ISSN-L), an umbrella ID for all media versions of the journal}
    \item{cr_year}{Earliest publication year (Crossref field `issued`)}
    \item{country_code}{The country where this institution is located, represented as an ISO two-letter country code. (OpenAlex field `country_code`)}
    \item{id}{The OpenAlex ID for this institution}
    \item{display_name}{The primary name of the institution (OpenAlex field `display_name`)}
    }

 To our knowledge, OpenAlex does not provide information about corresponding
 authors and their affiliation.
