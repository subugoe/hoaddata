#' Hybrid Journals listed in the Open Access Monitor
#'
#' The dataset contains hybrid journals available as filter in the
#' \href{https://open-access-monitor.de/}{German Open Access Monitor}.
#' The dataset was unified and enriched with ISSN variants and ISSN-L.

#' Prevalence of Creative Commons licenses by variant, year and journal
#'
#' This dataset contains the number and proportion of articles with Creative
#' Commons license (CC) by license variant and year for hybrid journals as
#' listed by the German Open Access monitor since 2017.
#'
#' Journal's article volume was calculated using the Crossref database snapshot.
#' Note that only articles published in regular issues aside from supplements
#' containing conference contributions like meeting abstracts,
#' indicated by non-numeric pagination were included. Also, non-scholarly
#' journal content, such as the table of contents were excluded,
#' following Unpaywall's paratext recognition approach, which was expanded to
#' include patterns indicating corrections.
#'
#' CC licenses were also identified through Crossref metadata records.
#' License information for author accepted manuscripts ("aam") and
#' with time lag between licensing and publication (delayed OA) were not
#' considered.

#' Variables:
#'
#' \describe{
#'     \item{issn_l}{Linking International Standard Serial Number (ISSN-L), an umbrella ID for all media versions of the journal}
#'     \item{cr_year}{Earliest publication year (Crossref field `issued`)}

#' First author country affiliations per journal, year and Creative Commons license
#'
#' This dataset contains the number and proportion of open access articles in
#' hybrid journals by country, year and Creative Commons license variant.
#'
#' Country affiliations were determined using the first author affiliation as
#' listed by OpenAlex.
#' A first author is often considered as lead
#' author(\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_author})
#' who has usually undertaken most of the research presented in the article,
#' although author roles can vary across disciplines.

#' Variables:
#' \describe{
#'     \item{issn_l}{Linking International Standard Serial Number (ISSN-L), an umbrella ID for all media versions of the journal}
#'     \item{cr_year}{Earliest publication year (Crossref field `issued`)}
#'     \item{country_code}{The country where this institution is located, represented as an ISO two-letter country code. (OpenAlex field `country_code`)}

#' Hybrid OA publishing output from first authors
#'
#' This dataset comprises affiliation information from first authors for each
#' open access article published in hybrid journals as listed in
