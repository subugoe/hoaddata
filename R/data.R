#' Prevalence of Creative Commons licenses by variant, year and journal
#'
#' This dataset contains the number and proportion of articles with Creative
#' Commons license (CC) by license variant and year for hybrid journals as
#' listed by the German Open Access monitor since 2017.
#'
#' Journal's article volume was calculated using the Crossref database snapshot.
#' Note that only articles published in regular issues aside from supplements
#' containing conference contributions like meeting abstracts,
#' indicated by non-numeric pagination were included. Also, non-scholarly
#' journal content, such as the table of contents were excluded,
#' following Unpaywall's paratext recognition approach, which was expanded to
#' include patterns indicating corrections.
#'
#' CC licenses were also identified through Crossref metadata records.
#' License information for author accepted manuscripts ("aam") and
#' with time lag between licensing and publication (delayed OA) were not
#' considered.
