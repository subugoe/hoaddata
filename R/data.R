#' Hybrid Journals listed in the Open Access Monitor
#'
#' The dataset contains hybrid journals available as a filter in the
#' \href{https://open-access-monitor.de/}{German Open Access Monitor}.
#' The dataset was unified and mapped to the
#' \href{https://www.crossref.org/titleList/}{Crossref title list}.
#'
#' There's no direct data exchange between Crossref and the ISSN agency.
#' Instead, publishers register journal-level metadata when they first deposit
#' metadata for a given journal, including all ISSN(s). Crossref makes sure that
#' article and journal metadata match.
#'
#' More info about Crossref's handling of ISSN registration can be found in this
#' support thread:

#' Prevalence of Creative Commons licenses by variant, year and journal
#'
#' This dataset contains the number and proportion of open access articles
#' with Creative Commons license (CC) by license variant and year for hybrid journals
#' included in the cOAlition S Journal Checker Tool.
#'
#' Publication period is 2017 - 2022.
#'
#' Journal's article volume was calculated using Crossref metadata snapshot.
#' Note that only articles published in regular issues aside from supplements
#' containing conference contributions like meeting abstracts,
#' indicated by non-numeric pagination, were included. Also, non-scholarly
#' journal content, such as the table of contents were excluded. In doing so,
#' we followed Unpaywall's paratext recognition approach, which we expanded to
#' include patterns indicating corrections.
#'
#' CC licenses were also identified through Crossref.
#' License information for author accepted manuscripts ("aam") were not
#' considered.
#'
#' Variables:
#'
#' \describe{
#'     \item{issn_l}{Linking ISSN}
#'     \item{cr_year}{Earliest publication year (Crossref field `issued`)}

#' First author country affiliations per journal, year and Creative Commons license
#'
#' This dataset contains the number and proportion of open access articles in
#' hybrid journals by country, year and Creative Commons license variant.
#'
#' Country affiliations were determined using the first author affiliation as
#' listed by OpenAlex.
#' A first author is often considered as lead
#' author(\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_author})
#' who has usually undertaken most of the research presented in the article,
#' although author roles can vary across disciplines.
#'
#' Note that full counting in which every original article or review was
#' counted once per country of affiliation of the first authors was applied.
#' Because first authors can have multiple affiliations from different countries,
#' don't use this dataset, but \code{\link{jn_ind}} to determine a journal's
#' publication volume.
#'
#' Variables:
#' \describe{
#'     \item{issn_l}{Linking ISSN}
#'     \item{cr_year}{Earliest publication year (Crossref field `issued`)}
#'     \item{country_code}{The country where this institution is located, represented as an ISO two-letter country code. (OpenAlex field `country_code`)}
#'     \item{cc}{Normalized Creative Commons variant. \code{NA} represents articles, which were not provided under a CC license}
#'     \item{articles_under_cc_variant}{Number of articles under Creative Commons variant, grouped by journal, year and country affiliation}

#' Hybrid OA publishing output from first authors
#'
#' This dataset comprises affiliation information from first authors for each
#' open access article published in hybrid journals as listed in
#' \link[hoaddata]{oam_hybrid_jns}.
#'
#' A first author is often considered as lead author (\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_author})
#' who has usually undertaken most of the research presented in the article,
#' although author roles can vary across disciplines.
#' We used OpenAlex as data source for determining the lead author's affiliation.
#'
#' In case where OpenAlex did not record an country affiliation, we extracted
#' country names from the display_name using regular expressions.
#'
#' Variables:
#'
#' \describe{
#'     \item{doi}{DOI for the OA article}
#'     \item{issn_l}{Linking ISSN}

#'
#'  To our knowledge, OpenAlex does not provide information about corresponding
#'  authors and their affiliation.
